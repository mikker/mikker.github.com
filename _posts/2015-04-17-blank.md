Oh, where do I even start.

Now and then I like to sport a completely stripped down Safari, hiding the toolbar and everything else:

Look at that! _Just_ the content. Just me and my one million tabs. Only problem: when I make a new tab, the address bar isn't focused as it is, when the toolbar is visible. So you need to press `cmd + l` yourself like an animal.

So we make a start-page for new tabs. But there's no api for focusing the browser chrome. But there _is_ AppleScript (there's always AppleScript).

We'll just make a tiny server that serves a page with one button that it clicks itself. And then make that button call some Applescript. That's definately not an insane solution to a very serious _problem_.

Sounds good? You should [try it out](https://github.com/mikker/blank).
