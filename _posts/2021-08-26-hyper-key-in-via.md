It's 2021 and you have a [mechanical keyboard](https://reddit.com/r/mechanicalkeyboards) that's configurable with [VIA][] and you want one of your keys to be a _hyper_ key. Meaning it should be the same as holding ⌃⌥⌘⇧ all at once.

It's possible! Set the key to _Any_ and put `MT(MOD_HYP, KC_NO)` as the key code.
