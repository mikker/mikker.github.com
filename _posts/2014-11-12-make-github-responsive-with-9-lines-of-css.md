My browser windows are seldomly as wide as Github's layout. This works great for most of the websites that I visit - yay responsive - but Github's layout is still too wiiiiiiide.

Taking matters into my own hands I opened up Web Inspector and found out that you can make it (naively) responsive with relatively few lines of css:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/mikker/bcdabb91dbdb8fbe38a7.js"></script>

Please do fork it and improve it.
